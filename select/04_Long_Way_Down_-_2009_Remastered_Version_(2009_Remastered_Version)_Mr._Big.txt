When it all comes tumbling down
We'll be telling lies and spitting out poison
The battle lines are drawn
Slow dancing with the devils on our own front lawn

So close to givin' up
Kiss it off and taking my chances
In a tug of war
You can't win when you don't know what
You're fighting for

A call for answers when love's in question
I hear a voice inside my head

Don't lose faith
Stand your ground
'Cause it's a long way down
Gone too far
To turn back now
It's a long way down

Too late when the damage is done
Running blind into the arms of strangers
We need a simple change of heart
Hold on before the whole thing falls apart

A call for answers when love's in question
I hear a voice inside my head

Don't lose faith
Stand your ground
'Cause it's a long way down
Gone too far
To turn back now
It's a long way down

A call for answers when love's in question
I hear a voice inside my head
Telling me that things are gonna get better

Don't lose faith
Stand your ground
'Cause it's a long way down
Gone too far
To turn back now
It's a long way down
Don't lose faith
Stand your ground
'Cause it's a long way down
Gone too far
To turn back now
It's a long way down
