Arkansas boys with their long, long drawls
And their deep, deep heart and soul
I'm down here where the sun don't sleep very long

It's a long, long, long way down
It's a long, long, long way down
It's a long, long, long way back down

Virginia, she keeps calling my name
She's like an old, old lover with her dark shady ways
But she knows where to hit me, yes she knows what works

It's a long, long, long way down
It's a long, long, long way down
It's a long, long, long way back down

I heard music in an old country home
Where hearts were breaking when they didn't even know they were broke

It's a long, long, long way down
It's a long, long, long way down
It's a long, long, long way back down
