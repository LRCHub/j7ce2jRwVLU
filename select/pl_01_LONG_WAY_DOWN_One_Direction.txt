We made a fire
Went down in the flames
We sailed an ocean
And drowned in a wave
Built a Cathedral
But we never prayed
We had it all yeah
And we walked away
Point of no return
And now it's just too late to
turn around
I try to forgive you
But I struggle cos I don't know
how
We built it up so high and now
I'm falling
It's a long way down
It's a long way down
From here
We had a mountain
But took it for granted
We had a spaceship
But we couldn't land it
We found an island
But we got stranded
We had it all yeah
Who could have planned it
Point of no return
And now it's just too late to
turn around
I try to forgive you
But I struggle cos I don't know
how
We built it up so high and now
I'm falling
It's a long way down
From here
Such a long way down
From here
it's a long way down
it's a long way down
Such a long way down
it's a long way down
it's a long way down
