Don't wait for me to leave
Just pretend that I'm not here
Our love is a fly on the wall
Slowing down just before the fall
Try to hang on
Baby, it's a long way down

Between each toll of the bell
When shadows move themselves
In the end it's not how you played
It's what you find while sweeping up the stage
When the idiot's gone
Baby, it's a long way down

He's under your bed
He's singing your song
Baby, it's a long way down

I could vanish into thin air
To join the ones you fear
What's the damage, we cut a deal
Let's give it time to let it heal
Hey, what if I'm wrong?
Going out of my head into your arms
Baby, it's a long way down
